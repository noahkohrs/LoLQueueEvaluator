# LoL Queue Calculator

## Overview
This Python tool is designed for League of Legends (LoL) players to analyze the concept of winner and loser queues. It calculates and interprets history to determine if a player is likely in a winner's queue (where the chances of winning are higher due to various factors) or a loser's queue (where the opposite is true). By assessing recent game statistics such as win rates, team performance, and player behaviors, the tool aims to provide insights into a player's current matchmaking status.
